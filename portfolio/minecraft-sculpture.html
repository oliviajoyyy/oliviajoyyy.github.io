<h1>Minecraft Sculpture</h1>

<p>
The significance of this project is to design in a virtual environment with the idea of it later being 3D printed. The sculpture was made to be an object of cultural significance.

<p>
I made a sculpture of the Iron Man helmet because it represents Marvel, which I am a big fan of. It is culturally significant because many people around the world have grown up watching the Marvel movies and/or reading the comic books. Marvel has been a big influence in pop culture, and it continues to be as they release new movies and shows.
