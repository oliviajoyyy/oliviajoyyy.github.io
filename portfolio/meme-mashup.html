<h1>Meme Mashup</h1>

<p>
A meme mashup creates something new and meaningful from the source memes. Each source meme has is own meaning, and when combined in the mashup, it creates something with a new meaning.
</p>

<p>
The base of this mashup is the disaster girl meme, and she is now the evil Kermit. The Elmo on her shoulder is supporting her in the chaos of the fire while the regular Kermit watches.
</p>

<p>
A version of the above without the evil Kermit meme.
