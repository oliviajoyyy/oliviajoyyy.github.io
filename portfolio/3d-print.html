<h1>3D Print</h1>

<p>
The objective of this project was to export the Minecraft Sculpture as an STL file and prepare it for a 3D Print. A small draft print was done first to understand how the sculpture should be rebuilt, if needed. Then a larger print was done to show the details of the sculpture. I finished my final piece by removing the scaffolding, filing the rough edges, and painting it. The final piece with color represents Ironman's helmet.
