<h1>Minecraft Sculpture</h1>

<p>
The objective of this project was to use a virtual environment to design a sculpture representing an object of cultural significance. The sculpture was also created with the idea in mind that it would later be 3D printed.

<h2>Iron Man Helmet</h2>

<p>
I created a sculpture of the Iron Man helmet because it represents Marvel, which I am a big fan of. It is culturally significant because many people around the world have grown up watching the Marvel movies and/or reading the comic books. Marvel has been a big influence in pop culture, and it continues to be as they release new movies and shows.

<h2>Baby Groot</h2>

<p>
I built this sculpture of Baby Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 because it was another way to represent Marvel. Moveover, the cultural significance of Baby Groot is about how his adorablness from the movie captured many people's attention.
